# HealthVault: Secure Health Information Management and Predictive Analytics

## Project Overview

HealthVault is a comprehensive application designed to securely store user health information, generate detailed health reports, and leverage advanced predictive analytics using synthetic datasets. The project aims to provide a secure vault for health records, generate comprehensive PDF reports, and utilize generative AI for health insights and predictions.

## Features

1. **Secure Vault for Health Records:**
   - Securely store user health records with encryption and access controls.
   - User authentication and authorization.

2. **PDF Generation:**
   - Generate neatly formatted PDF reports containing user health information.
   - Provide users with the option to download their health reports.

3. **Generative AI for Health Insights:**
   - Analyze user-uploaded content using generative AI APIs.
   - Provide health insights, summaries, areas of concern, drug information, and side effects.

4. **Advanced Predictive Analytics:**
   - Preprocess real-world medical records into a format compatible with the PyHealth library.
   - Perform predictive tasks such as mortality prediction, drug recommendation, sequential drug recommendation, and diagnosis prediction using synthetic datasets like MIMIC-III.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create a responsive and interactive frontend for the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Tailwind CSS is used to style the frontend components and ensure a consistent and modern look and feel.

### Backend

- **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. Flask is used to build the backend API for handling user authentication, health record storage, and PDF generation.
- **SQLAlchemy:** An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python. SQLAlchemy is used to interact with the database and manage health records.

### Database

- **Firebase:** A platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. Firebase is used for user authentication and real-time database storage.

### AI and Machine Learning

- **PyHealth:** A Python library for healthcare predictive modeling and analysis. PyHealth is used to preprocess medical records and perform predictive tasks using synthetic datasets like MIMIC-III.
- **Generative AI APIs:** APIs for analyzing user-uploaded content and providing health insights. These APIs are integrated into the backend to enhance the application's functionality.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend:** The frontend is built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for uploading health records, viewing health information, and downloading PDF reports.
- **Backend:** The backend is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy. It handles user authentication, health record storage, PDF generation, and integration with generative AI APIs.
- **Database:** Firebase is used for user authentication and real-time database storage. It ensures secure and efficient management of user data.
- **AI and Machine Learning:** PyHealth is used for preprocessing medical records and performing predictive tasks. Generative AI APIs are integrated into the backend to provide health insights.
